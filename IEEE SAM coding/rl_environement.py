"""Reinforcement Learning (RL) Environment for Open Spiel.

This module wraps Open Spiel Python interface providing an RL-friendly API. It
covers both turn-based and simultaneous move games. Interactions between agents
and the underlying game occur mostly through the `reset` and `step` methods,
which return a `TimeStep` structure (see its docstrings for more info).

The following example illustrates the interaction dynamics. Consider a 2-player
Kuhn Poker (turn-based game). Agents have access to the `observations` (a dict)
field from `TimeSpec`, containing the following members:
 * `info_state`: list containing the game information state for each player. The
   size of the list always correspond to the number of players. E.g.:
   [[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]].
 * `legal_actions`: list containing legal action ID lists (one for each player).
   E.g.: [[0, 1], [0]], which corresponds to actions 0 and 1 being valid for
   player 0 (the 1st player) and action 0 being valid for player 1 (2nd player).
 * `current_player`: zero-based integer representing the player to make a move.

At each `step` call, the environment expects a singleton list with the action
(as it's a turn-based game), e.g.: [1]. This (zero-based) action must correspond
to the player specified at `current_player`. The game (which is at decision
node) will process the action and take as many steps necessary to cover chance
nodes, halting at a new decision or final node. Finally, a new `TimeStep`is
returned to the agent.

Simultaneous-move games follow analogous dynamics. The only differences is the
environment expects a list of actions, one per player. Note the `current_player`
field is "irrelevant" here, admitting a constant value defined in spiel.h, which
defaults to -2 (module level constant `SIMULTANEOUS_PLAYER_ID`).

See open_spiel/python/examples/rl_example.py for example usages.
